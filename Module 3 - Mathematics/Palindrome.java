// If an number must change it's digit from 1's place to 10's place (move to left)
// we have to multiply it by 10
// If an number must change it's digit from 10's placed to 1's place (move to right)
// we have to divide it by 10

//Time complexity:
// Time complexity of this program is Î¸(d) where d is the number of digits
